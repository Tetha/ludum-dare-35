The game is split into a ring of particle emitters, and a bowl, which is a square grid of fields.

The game randomly places or upgrades particle emitters in red, blue or yellow on the rim.
During each turn, these emitters shoot a particle into the ring.

The player has cards to grow a strange blob in the bowl.

The following cards exist:

 - Particle absorbers. If a particle hits a particle absorber, the absorber stores it.
   If the absorber has two particles stored, it will turn the two particles into one
   piece of energy. If there is at least one other piece of blob around, the particle
   emitter will try to move that energy over there.

   The absorber can hold 3 energy at most. Once that energy is there, it destroys
   particles, but doesn't produce energy

 - Grower: A growing cell will consume energy pushed into it and add it to the players
   available energy. The player can spend this energy on buying new cells.

 - Point Generator. A Point generator consumes energy pushed into it and increases
   the score of the player

 - Router: The router pushes energy into a random direction.

   The router can push 5 energy at most, and store 10 energy at most.


The game ends if the entire bowl is full and the player is rated according to
his final score.
